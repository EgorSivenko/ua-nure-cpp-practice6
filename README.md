# Pawnshop Management System

## Spring Boot Web Application for managing the workflow of a pawnshop

The information system is designed to track the financial side of the pawnshop. Different people come to the pawnshop to receive money using certain goods as collateral. Personal data is recorded for each client. After assessing the value of the goods brought as collateral, the amount that is ready to be issued to the client is determined, as well as the commission. In addition, the term for the return of the money is determined. If the client agrees, the agreement is recorded by means of a document, the money is issued to the client, and the goods remain in the pawnshop. If the money is not returned within the specified period, the goods become the property of the pawnshop. After the transfer of ownership of the goods, the pawnshop can sell the goods at a price lower or higher than that stated upon delivery. The price can change several times depending on the market situation.
